1) install our packages, creating a package.json:

npm init -y

2) npm install - D for dev dependencies, we want eslint, prettier, the prettier plug-in and the prettier config as well as the node.js plugin
the node js gives us some extra rules retained to node

npm i -D eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-node eslint-config-node

=> these will get installed as dev dependencies

3) Now to the airbnb style guide: grab this

this will insatll eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks and eslint-plugin -jsx-a11y

    > If you dont want the react, you can use eslint-config-airbnb-base

    > this step will install all of the dependecies along with the airbnb as a dev dependency

npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb

4) Create your config file: .prettierrc

inside it, we want it to be a json object and the below is pasted inside:

    {
        "singleQuote": true
    }

> you can put any other prettier rules, to look these up, use the website: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html

5) creating an eslint configuration

you can create the file manually: .eslintrc.json

>> Or you can install eslint globally and you can generate it:

sudo npm install -g eslint

>> Now you can generate a config file using:

eslint --init
